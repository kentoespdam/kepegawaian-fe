description: >
  Whole-repo audit for over-engineering. Like ponytail-review, but scans the
  entire codebase instead of a diff: a ranked list of what to delete, simplify,
  or replace with stdlib/native equivalents. Use when the user says "audit this
  codebase", "audit for over-engineering", "what can I delete from this repo",
  "find bloat", "ponytail-audit", or "/ponytail-audit". One-shot report, does
  not apply fixes.

# Ponytail Audit

ponytail-review, repo-wide. Scan the whole tree instead of a diff. Rank findings biggest cut first.

## Tags

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `delete:` | Dead code, unused flexibility, speculative feature. Replacement: nothing. |
| `stdlib:` | Hand-rolled thing the standard library ships. Name the function. |
| `native:` | Dependency or code doing what the platform already does. Name the feature. |
| `yagni:` | Abstraction with one implementation, config nobody sets, layer with one caller. |
| `shrink:` | Same logic, fewer lines. Show the shorter form. |

## Targets

- Dependencies the stdlib or platform already ships
- Single-implementation interfaces
- Factories with one product
- Wrappers that only delegate
- Files exporting one thing
- Dead flags and config
- Hand-rolled stdlib functionality

## Output

One line per finding, ranked: `<tag> <what to cut>. <replacement>. [path]`.

End with `net: -<N> lines, -<M> deps possible.`

Nothing to cut: `Lean already. Ship.`

## Boundaries

Scope: over-engineering and complexity only. Correctness bugs, security holes, and performance are explicitly out of scope. Route them to a normal review pass. Lists findings, applies nothing. One-shot.

"stop ponytail-audit" or "normal mode" to revert.
