  Harvest every `ponytail:` comment in the codebase into a debt ledger, so the

# Ponytail Debt

Every deliberate ponytail shortcut is marked with a `ponytail:` comment naming its ceiling and upgrade path. This collects them into one ledger so a deferral can't quietly become permanent.

## Scan

Grep the repo for `ponytail:` comment markers, skipping `node_modules`, `.git`, and build output:

```
grep -rnE '(//|#|--) ?ponytail:' . --include='*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,py,go,rs,java,kt,swift}' | grep -v node_modules | grep -v .git
```

(Adjust include extensions for your stack.)

Each hit is one ledger row. The `ponytail:` prefix keeps prose that merely mentions the convention out of the ledger.

## Output

One row per marker, grouped by file:

`<file>:<line>, <what was simplified>. ceiling: <the limit named>. upgrade: <the trigger to revisit>.`

The convention is `ponytail: <ceiling>, <upgrade path>`, so pull the ceiling and the trigger straight from the comment.

Flag the rot risk: any `ponytail:` comment that names **no** upgrade path or trigger gets a `no-trigger` tag — those are the ones that silently rot.

End with `<N> markers, <M> with no trigger.`

Nothing found: `No ponytail: debt. Clean ledger.`

## Boundaries

Reads and reports only, changes nothing. To persist it, ask and it writes the ledger to a file (e.g. `PONYTAIL-DEBT.md`). One-shot.

"stop ponytail-debt" or "normal mode" to revert.
